			<p class="">We all grew up playing hopscotch on the playground. Chalk scratches across the sidewalk to form numbers that climb in value. We throw a rock and hop on one foot to see how far we can go without falling down. It’s childish, fun, not to be taken too seriously.</p>

									<p>In this performance, I am commenting on Illinois State University’s Administration and their failure to take the Covid-19 pandemic seriously. They have handled this crisis in a way that lacks maturity and empathy. They have failed. They have failed to provide their students with an adequate online learning experience. They have failed to keep super-spreader parties under control. They have failed to require routine testing. They have failed to reduce the cost of tuition and housing even when their students – customers – aren’t getting the experience they signed up for.</p>

									<p>In the first month of classes, Illinois State had 1400 Covid-19 cases on their campus. With the majority of the student body only being voluntarily tested. Illinois State University needs to take this pandemic seriously. It’s not a game. This is real life.</p>
